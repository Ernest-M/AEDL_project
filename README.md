# Acoustic Event Detection and Localisation
In this project, we perform:
Real-time implementation of Acoustic Event classification 
Real-time Acoustic Event Localisation.
We implemented the project using:
Raspberry Pi model 3B+
Matrix Voice development board
We use the Raspbian buster OS version downloaded from [here] (https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_oldstable_armhf/images/raspios_oldstable_armhf-2022-09-26/2022-09-22-raspios-buster-armhf.img.xz)
We setup the Matrix Voice device on the Raspberry Pi with instructions from [here] that entailed installation of the matrix kernel modules
Run the 'light' compiled cpp file to ensure the matrix voice device is being detected on the Raspberry Pi
